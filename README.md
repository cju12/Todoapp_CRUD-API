# Todoapp

Using Express.js, Mongoose mongoDB, EJS, CSS and Javascript, I made a simple webapp which allow users to set the goals, its priorities and deadlines, and display it on the webpage. 

Building a CRUD-api in express.js and node.js, allowing users to Create, Read, Update, Delete their goals.


Below is the todos for further development
** TODO **

Make the "/add" address to function as the same as the "/delete" and "/patch:ID" by using fetch api, and redirect user to the mainpage afterwards

Display the goals in an order from "high" priority to "low" (prolly, I can do that in mongodb?)

Show the time remaining till the deadline (If I can)


DESIGN THE WHOLE THING :(
