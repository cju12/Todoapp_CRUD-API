# Todoapp

Using Express.js, Mongoose mongoDB, EJS, CSS and Javascript, I made a simple webapp which allow users to set the goals, its priorities and deadlines, and display it on the webpage. 

Building a CRUD-api in express.js and node.js, allowing users to Create, Read, Update, Delete their goals.

This project is focused on how database(mongoDB) functions/works with a server, how items are saved and displayed through server and ejs files,
and finally, the mechanisms of CRUD-Api and how can it be implemented through node.js and express.js.
