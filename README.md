# Todoapp

Using Express.js, Mongoose mongoDB, EJS, CSS and Javascript, I made a simple webapp which allow users to set the goals, its priorities and deadlines, and display it on the webpage. 

Building a CRUD-API in Express.js and node.js, allowing users to Create, Read, Update, Delete their goals through a webpage.

This project is focused on how database(mongoDB) functions/works with a server from Express.js, how users can interact with servers through the APIs.
Additionally, how datas from the database are displayed on the webpage through EJS environment with a CSS design.
